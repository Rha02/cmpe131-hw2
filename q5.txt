1) increment_int_a does not change the variable after the function call
2) increment_int_b changes the variable after the function call
3) it differs because when an integer is sent as a paremeter, the integer value is copied and the function increments 
    this integer value in its scope. When a list is sent as a paremeter, not a copy but an actual reference to the
    list, with which the list can be changed.
